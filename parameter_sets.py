# A file for recording parameter value sets that lead to interesting results.

# 'Transitional chaos' in the VdH model:
eps = 0.18 # Rotor eccentricity
Om = 3.1 # Driving frequency
m = 10 # Mass (per unit length)
c = 0.05 # Damping coefficient
k = 1 # Stiffness coefficient
h = 1 # Gap width
k_c = 50 # Stator stiffness parameter for VdH model

# Rich spectrum of subharmonics in the NHS lubrication model:
eps = 0.2 # Rotor eccentricity
Om = 4.1 # Driving frequency
m = 10 # Mass (per unit length)
c = 0.5 # Damping coefficient
k = 10 # Stiffness coefficient
h = 1 # Gap width
mu = 10**-7 # Viscosity
b = 1 # Bearing length
R2 = 100 # Radius
