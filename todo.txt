Short term
----------
- Produce spectral plots across a range of parameters to illustrate
  interesting phenomena in Lubrication and VdH models.

- Extend these 'ranges of plots' to full brute-force bifurcations which
  produce heatmaps / waterfalls plots. Will require extremely long
  (overnight?) computations.

- Rewrite code using a general 'simulation' class to allow much easier
  processing of solutions (parameters will be saved as attributes of
  simulation objects)

Long term
---------
- Generalise dXdt to include cross-constants c1,c2,k1,k2?
- Add more models:
	- Full Sommerfeld (3.4.2)
	- Dynamic Half-Sommerfeld (3.4.4) 
	- One of the friction-based models?
	- Some kind of 'idealized' artificial nonlinearity?
