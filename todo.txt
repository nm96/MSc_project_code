Short term
----------
- Write short scripts which use the new simulation class to replicate and save
  earlier results

- Produce spectral plots across a range of parameters to illustrate
  interesting phenomena in Lubrication and VdH models.

- Extend these 'ranges of plots' to full brute-force bifurcations which
  produce heatmaps / waterfalls plots. Will require extremely long
  (overnight?) computations.

Long term
---------
- Generalise dXdt to include cross-constants c1,c2,k1,k2?
- Add more models:
	- Full Sommerfeld (3.4.2)
	- Dynamic Half-Sommerfeld (3.4.4) 
	- One of the friction-based models?
	- Some kind of 'idealized' artificial nonlinearity?
