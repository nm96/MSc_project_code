Short term
----------
- Produce spectral plots across a range of parameters to illustrate
  interesting phenomena in Lubrication and VdH models.
- Waterfall/heatmap plots?

Long term
---------
- Generalise dXdt to include cross-constants c1,c2,k1,k2?
- Add more models:
	- Full Sommerfeld (3.4.2)
	- Dynamic Half-Sommerfeld (3.4.4) 
	- One of the friction-based models?
	- Some kind of idealized artificial nonlinearity?
