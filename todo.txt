Short term
----------
- On spatial plots, add a circle to indicate collision between rotor and
  stator.

- Add more models:
	- Full Sommerfeld (3.4.2)
	- Naive Half-Sommerfeld (3.4.3)
	- Dynamic Half-Sommerfeld (3.4.4)
	- One of the other friction-based models?
	- Some kind of idealized artificial nonlinearity?

- Proper LaTeX labelling of plots

Long term
---------
- Generalise dXdt to include cross-constants c1,c2,k1,k2?
- Waterfall plots
